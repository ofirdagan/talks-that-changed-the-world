# Talks that changed the world (or my world) as I see it.

This is a list of technical talks that changed the way we think and write software. 
I really enjoyed seeing these talks and I try to get inspired from them as much as possible.

I keep reminding myslef that what may seems obvious to us now wasn't always the case. In some cases it wasn't so long ago ;)
