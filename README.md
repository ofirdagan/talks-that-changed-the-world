# Talks that changed the world (or my world) as I see it.

This is a list of technical talks that changed the way we think and write software. 
I really enjoyed seeing these talks and I try to get inspired from them as much as possible.

I keep reminding myslef that what may seems obvious to us now wasn't always the case. In some cases it wasn't so long ago ;)

* Introducing **NodeJS** by Ryan Dahl (2009) - [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztspvPYybIY)
* Introducing **gruntjs** by Ben Alman - (2012) [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp6aFno24x4)

* Hey Underscore, You're Doing It Wrong! - (2013) [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3svKOdZijA)  
  *This one by Brian Lonsdorf (also known as Professor Frisby) was a game changer for me. It made me "click" on what functional programming in javascript is. He doesn't talk about monads, functors or any advanced techniques but rather about the basics of functional composition. I ~~based~~ plagiarized my talk from his. (BenK)*
